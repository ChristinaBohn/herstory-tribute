            <h2>A history of pivotal events in the fight for Women's Rights in the United States</h2>
            <p>"Remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands. Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation."<br> - Future First Lady Abigail Adams to her husband, Founding Father John Adams, 1776</p>
